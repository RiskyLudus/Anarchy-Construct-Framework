# Anarchy Construct Framework

## Constructs: What Are They?

Constructs are best thought of as a noun inside of a world. I mean like a person, place, thing, or idea. In our use, constructs are used as a method of logically separating and organizing assets into understandable structures. For example, a drawbridge would be in the Drawbridge construct. It would hold everything about the drawbridge including (but not limited to) models, animations, scripts, shaders, materials, textures, audio, and so on.

## Getting Started

1. Download the package into your package manager (https://github.com/RiskyLudus/Anarchy-Construct-Framework.git)
2. Go to Anarchy -> Setup Wizard and set your desired settings.
3. Go to Anarchy -> Create Construct and make your first construct.
4. Wait for the construct to finish creation.
5. Make a setting in the Settings folder of your construct (right-click and you will find your construct under Create -> Anarchy -> Constructs -> Your Construct Data).
6. Add public fields you want to generate and any events you want to generate in the settings.
7. Go to Anarchy -> Update Bindings and let the code auto-generate your Unity Events.
